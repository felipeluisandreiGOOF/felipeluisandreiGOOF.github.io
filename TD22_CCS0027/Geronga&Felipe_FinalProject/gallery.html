            <img src="images/EVENING IN THE ROOM (1935).png" alt="The artpiece illustrates a crowded room, where the furnitures are lit by the moonlight. Although just being still-life, Schmidt-Rottluff's work was labeled as 'denegerate' by the Nazis, which restricted his institutional support and subjected him to political suppression. This affected his pieces by reflecting the challenges he faced at that time." onclick="openModal(this)">
